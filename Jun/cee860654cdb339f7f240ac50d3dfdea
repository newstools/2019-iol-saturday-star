It announced this week that all stalls had been taken, and applications to exhibit were therefore closed. The fair will be held at the Durban ICC and Exhibition Centre from September 22-29, and provides a platform for entrepreneurs to showcase products, network, learn and grow their businesses. Mayor Zandile Gumede said the city’s efforts to support small businesses were paying dividends. “The swift response displayed by businesses is remarkable, it shows the confidence they have in the fair, and the opportunities it gives them for brand visibility and to access markets. We want these businesses clinching big deals to rake in more profits,” she said. Gumede added that the fair celebrated its 21st year of growth and success this year, and was set to surpass standards set in previous years. “We’ve earmarked influential speakers and prominent celebrities in various business sectors who will share their expertise. We’re confident that after the fair, owners of these businesses would have amassed knowledge and information to grow.” Film-making, music production, fashion masterclasses, food and wine pairing, pottery and other industries will all be part of the fair this year.
