The training workshop was hosted by the eThekwini Municipality's Economic Development department, the South African Footwear and Leather Export Council (SAFLEC) and the Southern African Footwear and Leather Industries Association (Saflia). Lecturers from the Milan-based footwear and leather goods consultancy, Arsutoria, conducted the workshop, which outlined the latest design trends, production processes, and how to analyse trends to create a collection for an international market. Maria Cristina, who has been in charge of the collection line development at Gianni Versace for more than 12 years, Stefano Migliavacca, Arsutoria’s international promotions manager, and Georgia Roehe Turri, who has her own brands Georgia Turri and Getu, conducted the lectures. The workshop was aimed at stimulating the local shoe design industry. Lerato Hlalele, a designer of safety boots for a Pinetown- based company, said the workshop was an eye-opener. “We should have more seminars like this as we have the potential to grow and enter the international market with locally-produced goods,” she said.
