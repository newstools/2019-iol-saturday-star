A man lost his right hand late Friday afternoon after an explosion ripped through a home in a residential complex on Hobart Road in Bryanston, Sandton. The adult male also suffered extensive burns and had to be treated by an Advanced Life Support paramedic before being transported to hospital by ambulance. Shawn Herbst, the media liaison officer for Netcare 911, said paramedics initially responded to reports of a shooting but arrived at the scene to find a house that had been extensively damaged. “The windows and doors had been blown out,” said Herbst, who added that it is believed that the man was working with fireworks when the explosion happened. A photograph that appeared on Twitter showed black smoke over Bryanston, with people reporting to have heard a loud bang. Police were investigating the cause of the explosion, with members of the bomb disposal team on site. The Saturday Star
