They often have fish in from Mozambique and if you’re on their notification list, you’ll always know what’s at the height of freshness. Last year Paolo made over 70 paellas in town. They need around 24 to 48 hours notification and have pans large enough to serve 120 people. The standard paella consists of chorizo imported from Portugal, dorado or kingklip, mussels, Mozambique prawns, clams, calamari tubes, rings and tentacles.
