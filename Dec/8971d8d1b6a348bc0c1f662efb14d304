Johannesburg - Through no fault of her own, Miss Sweden was torn to shreds on Twitter in defence of the newly crowned Miss Universe, Zozibini Tunzi. A curious tweet from a French account sought to compare Tunzi (Miss South Africa 2019) with her Swedish counterpart Lina Ljungberg, who was one of the more than 60 contestants vying for the crown. Ljungberg had previously entered the Miss International pageant and had been expected to finish in the top five. However she did not make it beyond the top 20. The tweet from @Damocles_Fr read: “On the left, Miss South Africa elected #MissUniverse2019. On the right, Miss Sweden eliminated to give her the place. Which of the two is the most beautiful without ideology, according to you?” (The tweet was translated by Google.) À gauche, miss Afrique du Sud élue #MissUniverse2019.À droite, miss Suède éliminée pour lui laisser la place.Laquelle des deux est la plus belle sans idéologie, selon vous ? pic.twitter.com/NI5F2DlOSc Well, I can throw a rock in a US city and hit 50 women that look exactly like Miss Sweden there... While Miss Universe has a unique beauty about her that's absolutely flawless. Lol same Miss Sweden has the look of white South African pretty blondes,common and regular. Think Charlize Theron, many more of her where’s she’s from in Benoni.
