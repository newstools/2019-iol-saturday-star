Awqaf SA have partnered with Nacademy and Siyafunda CTC, an organisation that assists communities with access to technology. The aim is to empower businesswomen through the #SheMeansBusiness programme Awqaf SA is an organisation that empowers communities. Project manager Hasanain Abdullah said: “There’s a digital skills gap. More affluent communities have access to digital skills development through masterclasses which tend to be more expensive. Less affluent communities don’t have access to these training resources.” Abdullah said training workshops didn’t often go to black and coloured townships, and there was a need for the upgrade of skills in these areas due to the advancement of technology. Business owners needed to become more skilled in this area to reach target markets which engage with social media. The one-day workshop will provide digital, business development and entrepreneurial knowledge. Workshop participant Sandre Zwane, 65, said: “As a pensioner, I’ve gained some confidence being part of this workshop and I’m proud to see many young women attending. Though they have degrees, many still don’t know what they want to do.” Another workshop participant, Siphoskazi Mgqaliso, said: “The workshop has taught me to market my business and use social media to do this and get more customers. I also learned how to advertise through apps.” Workshops were held in Nyanga and Woodstock last week. The next workshops will be tomorrow at Harare City Hall, Khayelitsha, and on Wednesday at Ward 91, Site B, Khayelitsha. sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus
