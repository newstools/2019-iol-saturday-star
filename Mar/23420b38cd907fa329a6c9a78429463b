Colombia la Maseta, Burundi Kibira and Ethiopia Guji come together to form the unique three-bean blend of the Supertech Group’s very own premium coffee. They launched the brew on Friday at the opening of the R150 million state-of-the-art dealership which, apart from its coffee shop and full-time internationally experienced chefs, also includes Motorrad, so that BMW bikers can also experience world class facilities and services. Motorrad is BMW’s motorcycle brand and part of its corporate and brand development division. More than 500 employees benefited from the BMW skills developments programme, according to Supertech group chairman Shabir Tayob. “The opening of the new dealership highlights our commitment to investment, job creation and social responsibility in the area. In addition to retailing BMWs and offering excellent customer care, we have already engaged with several community initiatives,” he said. “Supertech Durban was founded in 1983. It consists of branches in Durban, Newcastle, Pinetown, Pietermaritzburg, Shelly Beach and East London,” said Yusuf Moolla, group marketing and communications manager. Tim Abbot, managing director for BMW South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, said: “BMW has been in partnerships in South Africa for 46 years. Our plant is here. We have invested in SA because the quality here is second to none.” THE MERCURY
