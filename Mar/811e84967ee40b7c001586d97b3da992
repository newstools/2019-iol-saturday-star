The R1.4billion commercial development, which was conceptualised by Eris Property Group in partnership with Prasa and Intersite Asset Investments, offers tailor-built stores space to house a business showroom, office space and distribution centre within one site. “Having introduced this concept to the public and local businesses six months ago, we can clearly see by the immense interest that there is a huge demand for a commercial property offering such as Umgeni Deco & Lifestyle Park. “As a result, we have partnered with a number of key retailers and look forward to welcoming them to Umgeni Deco & Lifestyle Park in the near future,” said Stephen Lawson, developer manager from Eris Property Group. Construction on the site has started and phase A is expected to be completed by October. The development aims to formalise the vibrant node, offering high-spec infrastructure, management association, a green environment, and a comprehensive framework of complementary services. THE MERCURY
