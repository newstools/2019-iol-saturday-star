Authorities are searching for four alleged robbers who are believed to have stolen millions of rands worth of jewelry and diamonds from a shop in Sandton, Johannesburg. The robbery took place last month at House of Ameera in Nelson Mandela Square, where millions of rands of watches and diamonds were stolen in broad daylight. CCTV camera footage from the store identified the group as Aneeqa Geldenhuys, Zelka Armino, Aashif Reylands and his brother Nasief Reylands.  Private Investigator, Heindrick Viljoen said the two alleged robbers were believed to be notorious gang members from the Cape Flats. “Two men and two women were positively identified from CCTV footage and could assist with investigations,” he said. “They are in hiding and could possibly by around the Johannesburg or Cape Town areas.” The alleged robbers are believed to be dangerous and Viljoen said they should not be approached directly.  However, he urged those who might have information on the group to come forward. “ We will pay a reward of up to R100 000 for all their arrests,” Viljoen said.
